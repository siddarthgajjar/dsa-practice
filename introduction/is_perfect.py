# Given the Number of Test Cases as T,
# For each test case, take an integer N as input, you have to tell whether it is a perfect number or not.

# A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors (excluding the number itself). 
# A positive proper divisor divides a number without leaving any remainder.

# Problem Constraints
# 1 <= T <= 10
# 1 <= N <= 106

# Input Format
# The first line of the input contains a single integer T. 
# Each of the next T lines contains a single integer N.

# Output Format
# For each testcase, print YES if the given integer is perfect, else print NO, in a separate line

# Example Input
# Input 1:
    # 2
    # 4
    # 6
# Input 2:
    # 1
    # 3

# Example Output
# Output 1:
    # NO
    # YES 
# Output 2:
    
# Example Explanation
# Explanation 1:
    # For the first test case A = 4, the answer is "NO" as sum of its proper divisors = 1 + 2 = 3, is not equal to 4.
    # For the second test case A = 6, the answer is "YES" as sum of its proper divisors = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, is equal to 6.
# Explanation 2:
    # For the first test case A = 3, the answer is "NO" as sum of its proper divisors = 1, is not equal to 3.
